# Spam & Fake News Detection using NLP Classification

## Overview
A machine learning project to classify text as spam (emails/SMS) or fake news using NLP techniques.

## Features
- Detects spam messages and fake news articles
- Interactive Gradio interface for real-time testing
- Compares multiple ML algorithms
- Visualizes results and saves models

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **scikit-learn** (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- **pandas, numpy**
- **nltk**
- **matplotlib, seaborn**
- **Gradio**
- **joblib**

## What I've Done
- Preprocessed and vectorized text data
- Trained and evaluated ML models
- Built an interactive demo with Gradio
- Visualized and saved model results
